# Entertain Eugene
Widget to find information on concerts in Eugene. Currently uses data from four major theaters in Eugene. Offers three use cases: 
<p> 1. "Search by Artist": Enter the name of a performer to check if they are performing soon. </p>
<p> 2. "Search by Date": Enter a starting and ending date to view all of the shows occurring in that time. </p>
<p> 3. "Search by Venue": Select up to four venues to view upcoming events. </p>

Current expansion plan is to add a button to update the database and rerun the scraper. 

To run, go into the terminal and the folder with concert_scan.py: 

python3 concert_scan.py
